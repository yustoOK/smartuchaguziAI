Fraud Detection Dataset Description (The whole group should read this)
======================================================================

Dataset Size: 1,500,000 samples (We may increase this by incrementing the n_sample number/value)

Features:
1. time_diff (float): Time difference between consecutive votes in seconds
   - Normal range: 5-30 seconds
   - Fraud range: 0.1-3 seconds
   - Noise: ±10% Gaussian noise

2. votes_per_user (int): Number of votes cast by a single user
   - Normal range: 1-2 votes
   - Fraud range: 3-10 votes
   - Noise: ±10% Gaussian noise, minimum 1

3. voter_id (string): Unique voter identifier
   - Format: T[YY]-03-[NNNNN]
   - YY: Year (21-23)
   - NNNNN: 5-digit number (00000-99999)
   - Example: T22-03-06448

4. avg_time_between_votes (float): Average time between user's votes
   - Normal range: 4-20 seconds
   - Fraud range: 0.1-2 seconds
   - Noise: ±10% Gaussian noise, minimum 0.1

5. vote_frequency (float): Votes per minute
   - Normal range: 0.1-0.5
   - Fraud range: 0.8-2.0
   - Noise: ±10% Gaussian noise, minimum 0.01

6. vpn_usage (int): Whether VPN is used (0 = no, 1 = yes)
   - Normal: 20% chance of VPN (p=0.2)
   - Fraud: 70% chance of VPN (p=0.7)
   - Noise: 5% chance of random flip

7. multiple_logins (int): Number of concurrent logins
   - Normal range: 1-2
   - Fraud range: 2-5
   - Noise: ±10% Gaussian noise, minimum 1

Labels:
- 0: Normal voting behavior
- 1: Potentially fraudulent behavior

Distribution:
- Approximately 50% normal, 50% fraud samples
- Randomly generated with controlled ranges and added noise to simulate real-world variability

Usage:
- Designed for training a neural network to detect voting fraud
- Numeric features should be normalized before model input
- voter_id is used for tracking but encoded numerically (last 5 digits) for ML
- Noise ensures robustness to legitimate variations (e.g., VPN use from home)
